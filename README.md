# What it can do
- Show the feed of your subscribed channels
- Play the video with mpv (or any other video player)
- Subscribe to a channel in the application
- Filtering out unwanted videos in the feed
- A watch-later list

# What it cannot do (yet)
Tell me what features you want to be included by opening an [issue](https://github.com/Schmiddiii/Tubefeeder/issues).

# What it (probably) will never be able to do
- Play videos in the application: There are just so many good video players out there that forcing one inside the application would worsen the experience.

# Supported Platforms

- Youtube (using Piped as the backend to prevent throttling)
- PeerTube
- Lbry

Suggest any other platform, if it has a good-enough API, I will consider adding it.

# Wiki
Please also take a look at the [wiki](http://www.tubefeeder.de/wiki/) if you have any problems (e.g. mpv being slow on the PinePhone) or don't know how to do something (e.g. subscribing to a channel)
